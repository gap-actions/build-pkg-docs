# build-pkg-docs

This GitHub action runs compiles the manual of a GAP package.

## Usage

The action `build-pkg-docs` has to be called by the workflow of a GAP
package `gap-package`.
By default it compiles the manual of a GAP package, and fails if any warnings
are generated during this process.

Its behaviour can be customized via the inputs below.

### Inputs

All of the following inputs are optional.

- use-latex:
  - if `true`, then install and use latex
  - default: `false`
- warnings-as-errors:
  - if `true` then any errors produced whilst building the documentation will be
    treated as errors
  - default: `true`

- a minimal example to run this action, and
